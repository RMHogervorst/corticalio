Basic idea is to use the Cortical.io API from within R. 
Call all the endpoints from a function. Result is always a useful data frame or
other result. 

Got the basic functionality fixed. 

### Working

[x] - Term endpoint, GET 3 of the 3 types with response
[x] - basic api key function that finds the correct key in Renviron or asks you for one.
[x] - retina endpoint GET one function (not that usefull per se, could be used for demo purpose)
[x] - 4 of the 6 text inputs



### TODO

[] default in every call to search for token, if not found, give error:
make it that api_key = NULL, so it can be used. but defaults to 
key <- api_key(api) So that internally the api search is called. 
if the api key is not null use the one provided. don't do anything else.

[] create parsers for every type of output to dataframe. 

[] find a way to handle the retina returns. parse to sparse matrix.

[] bulk post to text. 


- Retina,  GET 1 type
- Term, GET 3 types [x]
- Text, POST  6 types
- Expression, POST 6 types.
- Compare, POST 2 types compare and compare bulk JSON input
- Image,  POST/ 3 types
- Classify post, need FilterTraininObject and name for filter.





# Background information
according to website: [cortical.io ](http://www.cortical.io/technology.html)
WARNING a lot of BIG data terms and buzzwords. 

In short, the Retina is a sparse distributed semantic space (also referred to as Distributional Memory [Baroni2010]). 

api has two types of retinas
"retinaName": "en_synonymous","An English language retina focusing on synonymous similarity.",
and     "retinaName": "en_associative",
    "description": "An English language retina balancing synonymous and associative similarity."
    
HTTP Status Code 	Reason
200 	Indicates a successful operation.
404 	Indicates that the resource was not found. Returns a JSON object with a detailed error message and a description of a possible resolution.

REST API

The API endpoints related to term input are:

    terms retrieve semantic representation for a term
"http://api.cortical.io/rest/terms?retina_name=en_associative&term=computer&start_index=0&max_results=10&get_fingerprint=false"
    terms/similar_terms get similar terms for a term
"http://api.cortical.io/rest/terms/similar_terms?retina_name=en_associative&term=apple&start_index=0&max_results=10&pos_type=NOUN&get_fingerprint=false"
    terms/contexts get contexts for a term
"http://api.cortical.io/rest/terms/contexts?retina_name=en_associative&term=apple&start_index=0&max_results=5&get_fingerprint=false"



HTTP errors
HTTP Status Code 	Reason
200 	Indicates a successful operation.
400 	Indicates an incorrect request. Returns a JSON object with a detailed error message and a description of a possible resolution.
404 	Indicates that the resource was not found. Returns a JSON object with a detailed error message and a description of a possible resolution.
500 	Indicates a possible database or I/O error. Returns a JSON object with a detailed error message and a description of a possible resolution.
In reality:
http status 401 unauthorized access. 
Does not return a json object but a serialized string.
